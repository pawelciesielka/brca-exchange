Component likelihoods and final classification are from multifactorial likelihood analysis, which is a quantitative integrated evaluation of variant pathogenicity.
* #### Posterior Probability of pathogenicity \(ExUV\) ((Posterior_probability_exLOVD))
    This value is the posterior probability of pathogenicity from ExUV.
* #### Prior probability of pathogenicity \(ExUV\) ((Combined_prior_probablility_exLOVD))
    This value is the combined prior probability in favor of pathogenicity. It is a combination of the missense analysis prior probability and the splicing analysis prior probability. Generally, it is the higher of these two prior probabilities. From ExUV.
* #### Missense analysis probability of pathogenicity \(ExUV\) ((Missense_analysis_prior_probability_exLOVD))
    This prior probability estimate combines position in the protein with an evaluation of missense substitutions that fall in the proteins key functional domains. From ExUV.
* #### Co-occurrence likelihood \(ExUV\) ((Co_occurrence_LR_exLOVD))
    This value is the likelihood ratio based on the frequency of co-occurrence between the variant of interest and clearly pathogenic variants in the same gene. From ExUV.
* #### Segregation Likelihood Ratio \(ExUV\) ((Segregation_LR_exLOVD))
    This value is the likelihood ratio based on segregation analysis
* #### Summary Family History Likelihood Ratio \(ExUV\) ((Sum_family_LR_exLOVD))
    This value is the likelihood ratio based on an analysis of the severity of summary family histories of breast and/ or ovarian cancer.
